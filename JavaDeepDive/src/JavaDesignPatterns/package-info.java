package JavaDesignPatterns;

/**
 *  Strategy Design Pattern
 *  Used in situations where there is more than one algorithm that a method can execute. The client can select which algorithm will execute
 *  at runtime
 *  Example: Collections.sort() and ArrayList.sort()
 *
 *  My Example: Suppose a bank has an application that can onboard merchants via QR, WEB or POS (depending on which is selected at runtime),
 *  implement a simple system that can handle all three dynamically.
